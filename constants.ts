Frequently asked questions about Gemini

What is Gemini?
Gemini is a family of multimodal models developed by Google and is the next generation of our most capable model. It is designed for multimodality and can reason seamlessly across text, images, video, audio, and code.
Gemini is our most flexible model yet and is available in four sizes:
*   Ultra is our most capable and largest model for highly complex tasks.
*   Pro is our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.
*   Flash is a lightweight, fast and cost-efficient model for high frequency tasks.
*   Nano is our most efficient model for on-device tasks.

How is Gemini different from other models?
Gemini was built from the ground up to be multimodal. This pre-training on different modalities helps Gemini seamlessly understand and reason about all kinds of inputs, far better than existing multimodal models.
Gemini's sophistication in multimodal reasoning can help make sense of complex written and visual information. It is particularly adept at explaining its reasoning when it comes to subjects like math and physics.

What can I do with the Gemini API?
The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini family of models. You can use it to build AI applications for a variety of use cases, such as:
*   Content generation for a variety of audiences and channels.
*   Summarization of long or complex content.
*   Building a chatbot to have a conversation about a particular subject.
*   Translating between languages.
*   Extracting information from text, images, video, and audio.
